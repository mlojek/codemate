# codemate
Codemate is a LLM-powered CLI tool to help software developers with repetitive and boring tasks. Codemate allows you to refactor your code, add docstrings, insert code snippets and explain hard to understand fragments of code.

## Installation
Firstly, clone this repository. In a python environment run:
```
make install
```
This will install all necessary dependencies. Python 3.11 and above is required.

## Create configuration
Codemate can be configured by a `~/.codemate` config file. It holds user's LLM API keys. The user has to create it by hand. Then, paste the following config template and add your keys:
```.env
# gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your api key goes here'
GEMINI_FAV_MODEL = 'name of the default model'

# openai
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your api key goes here'
OPENAI_FAV_MODEL = 'name of the default model'
```

## Functionalities
Codemate allows for a few useful actions to be done:  
üîß `refactor` - Refactor the source code.  
üßë‚Äçüè´ `explain` - Add explainatory comments.  
üìñ `document` - Add docstrings and typehints.  
ü™Ñ `insert` - Create new piece of code according to comments.

                        Action that the assistant should take.

  --from_line FROM_LINE
                        The line number (starting from 0) in the source file to start from.
  --to_line TO_LINE     The line number (starting from 0) in the source file to end before (this line is not included).
  --api {gemini,openai}
                        Which LLM API to use.
  --model MODEL         Name of LLM to use.
  --inplace             If used the result will be pasted into the source file instead of the console.
